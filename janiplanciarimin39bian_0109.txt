Eraesidi.'' Catherine l. Wolfe presented the extensive
shell collection and library amassed byeltefifflp Dr.
John C. Jay (1808-1891) to the American Museum of
Natural History, yet they disposed of his own Catalogue
(1850) which was interleaved and contained his
annotations‚ even though the book plate indicated that it
was the “Wolfe Memorial Gift: Jay Library.’' Among
duplicates sold by the library of the Museum of
Comparative Zoology in 1964 was a copy of Seczside
Studies by (1865) Elizabeth Cary Agassiz (1822-1907)
and Alexander Agassiz (1835-1910). This was a
popular book which Alexander helped his stepmother to
write, and is inscribed, “A.Agassiz‚ Nahant, August
1865.” Nahant being the summer seat of the Agassiz
family. While the bool<plate indicates that it was
deposited by Alex. Agassiz in the library of the
Museum of Comparative Zoology‚ it suffered the same
fate as the other items mentioned. All three of these
worl<s are now in the Department of Mollusks.
